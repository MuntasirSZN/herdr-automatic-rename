# herdr-automatic-rename configuration.
#
# Copy to ~/.config/herdr-automatic-rename/config.sh and uncomment what you want to
# change (or point $HERDR_AUTOMATIC_RENAME_CONFIG somewhere else). This file is sourced
# by automatic-rename.sh BEFORE naming.sh, so anything set here wins over the defaults.
# Every setting has a working default, so an empty config is fine.

# ---- feature toggles (both default on) ----

# Auto-name each tab after its foreground program (the shell name at a bare
# prompt). Set to 0 to leave tab names alone.
# NAME_TABS=1

# Prefix workspaces and tabs with their 1-9 jump-key number, e.g. "[2] api". Set
# to 0 to name without numbering. Agents are included only on herdr < 0.7.5:
# newer herdr rejects a bracketed agent name, so those rows keep their detected
# names (and lose any prefix an older setup left on them).
# AUTO_INDEX=1

# Numbering, per item kind. Each defaults to AUTO_INDEX and overrides it when
# set, so AUTO_INDEX stays the one knob for "number everything" or "number
# nothing" and these carve out the exceptions. Numbered tabs with plain
# workspace names, for instance, is the first line on its own:
# AUTO_INDEX_WORKSPACES=0
# AUTO_INDEX_TABS=1
# AUTO_INDEX_AGENTS=1
#
# Setting one of these to 0 also removes the prefixes already on those rows, on
# the next herdr event -- no need to run the "clear" action.
#
# That cleanup cannot tell one "[N] " apart from another. Nothing records which
# prefixes this plugin wrote, so a name you typed yourself that starts with a
# bracketed number, say "[1] incident", loses the bracket too. Naming the kind
# here is how you ask for the cleanup and accept that. A config with only
# AUTO_INDEX=0 in it never triggers it, so workspace and agent labels stay as
# they are. Tabs are the exception, and only under NAME_TABS=1: that pass runs
# for the naming, and has always taken the prefix off on its way through.
# Anything else in brackets ("[wip] foo") is left alone, digits are the only
# trigger.

# ---- naming knobs (only used when NAME_TABS=1) ----

# 1 = put the CONTEXT in front of the program: the directory the pane sits in,
# the branch it has checked out, the machine it reached over ssh, joined with
# CONTEXT_SEP -- "api › MC-13675 › nvim". A tab says what is running; without
# this half, five agent tabs across three checkouts read alike. 0 names by the
# program alone.
#
# The directory is refused when it says nothing a tab bar has room for: your home
# directory, the filesystem root, and the name of the workspace the tab is in
# (herdr shows that above the tabs already, so repeating it there spends half the
# width on what is on screen anyway). A worktree counts as the same place as its
# workspace: herdr names one after the branch with the convention in front
# stripped, so a "bugfix-proj-482-fix" directory under a "proj-482-fix" workspace
# says nothing new.
#
# A directory too long for MAX_CONTEXT_LEN is reduced the way a branch is, not
# cut through the middle: worktrees and branches are named the same way by the
# same people, so "bugfix-proj-482-fix-rev-discrepancy" reads as "PROJ-482".
# TAB_CONTEXT=1
#
# A pane running ssh is named after the machine it reached instead ("prod-01 ›
# ssh"): its directory is the local one it was launched from, and the branch
# checked out there would read as the remote machine's. The user is dropped,
# because root@prod-01 and deploy@prod-01 are the same machine.

# 1 = qualify the context with the branch the pane's repository has checked out:
# "api › MC-13675 › nvim". It says which slice of a project a tab is on, where
# the directory alone says only which project.
#
# The branch is read from the files under .git and never by running git, so it
# costs no process. Three rules keep it quiet: the repository's own default
# branch is left out (every tab would carry it alike, and which branch that is
# comes from the repository rather than a list of names), a branch that fits is
# shown whole, and one that does not is reduced -- to its issue key where it has
# one ("bugfix-asa-cpanel-uapi-mc-13675" -> "MC-13675"), else to the part after
# the last "/", cut at a whole word.
# SHOW_BRANCH=1
#
# A branch that repeats what is already on screen is dropped as well: a worktree
# named after its branch would otherwise say one thing three times ("auto-title >
# auto-title > Rename the tabs"), since herdr shows the workspace above the tabs.

# Longest branch a label may carry, in characters. 0 leaves branches out, the
# same as SHOW_BRANCH=0. An issue key is shown whole even when it exceeds this:
# half a key identifies nothing.
# MAX_BRANCH_LEN=12

# The branches treated as a trunk when the repository records no default of its
# own -- one cloned without an origin/HEAD, or one that was never cloned. Without
# this such a repository shows its branch on every tab alike, which is the column
# of noise the trunk rule exists to prevent. A repository that DOES record a
# default is believed over this list, so a team whose trunk is "release" is not
# second-guessed. TRUNK_BRANCHES=() shows every branch in such a repository.
# TRUNK_BRANCHES=(main master develop trunk)

# Truncate the directory part to this many characters. It is a project name, not
# a sentence, and the program beside it still needs the room MAX_NAME_LEN gives
# it, so it has a budget of its own rather than eating that one.
# MAX_CONTEXT_LEN=12

# What joins the parts of a label. Written as a literal character; the default is
# U+203A, a single right-pointing angle quote.
# CONTEXT_SEP=' › '

# 1 = a regular program shows its full command line ("psql -h db"); 0 = just its
# name ("psql"). Default 0.
# SHOW_PROGRAM_ARGS=0

# Truncate the program name to this many characters (counted by codepoint). Each
# part of a label has a budget of its own -- MAX_CONTEXT_LEN for the directory,
# MAX_TITLE_LEN for an agent's task -- so the whole is bounded by the sum rather
# than by a total you would have to keep in step with the parts.
# MAX_NAME_LEN=20

# 1 = name a tab running a coding agent after the task the agent reports in its
# terminal title ("Squash merge command") instead of after the program
# ("claude"), which is what tells five claude tabs apart. herdr publishes the
# title on the pane, so the label costs no extra call. A title that names the
# agent rather than the work, one that is just the pane's directory, and a bare
# number are refused, and the tab falls back to the program name (aliases
# included). 0 names every agent tab after its program.
# AGENT_TITLES=1

# What an agent tab shows once there is a task to show. "task" is the released
# answer, the task alone. "name_and_task" keeps the agent in front of it,
# "claude:auth-flow", or through PROGRAM_ALIASES "cc:auth-flow".
#
# Which agent is on a task is not otherwise recoverable from the tab: every agent
# herdr detects draws the same robot glyph, and the title replaces the one place
# the program name appeared. In a session running one agent that costs nothing; in
# one running three, "cc:" and "oc:" are what tell two tabs apart.
#
# The name is charged to MAX_TITLE_LEN like everything else, so it comes out of
# what the task may spend rather than making the tab wider -- though a label that
# was under the budget does get longer: "auth flow" becomes "cc:auth flow".
#
# The prefix is all or nothing. Where the budget cannot seat the name, its colon
# and MIN_TASK_LEN characters of task, the NAME goes: this asks for the task with
# the name added, not the other way about, and a tab reading only "cursor-agent"
# would be the one thing it must not do. A refused title is not prefixed either --
# the tab falls back to the program name, and "cc:cc" says nothing twice.
# TITLE_STYLE=task

# The least task worth printing beside a name, used by the rule above.
# MIN_TASK_LEN=7

# 1 = when a coding agent has NOT titled its terminal, read what its own session
# says it is about. Claude Code derives that title from what you typed, so a
# session you opened with a slash command and never typed a prompt into is never
# given one, and its tab reads "claude" for as long as it runs. Only Claude Code
# is read; any other agent is named from its terminal title exactly as before.
#
# What it reads is the title Claude Code generated for the session, or failing
# that your first prompt -- which is what Claude Code's own session list shows
# for an untitled session. It reads that out of the transcript file on disk, so
# set this to 0 if you would rather nothing read it. herdr has to have told the
# plugin which session the pane holds, which is what `herdr integration install
# claude` sets up; without it there is nothing to read and this does nothing.
# AGENT_TRANSCRIPT=1

# Truncate a title to this many characters, at a word boundary when that leaves
# most of the budget. A title is a sentence rather than a command name, so it
# needs more room than MAX_NAME_LEN gives -- and with numbering on the "[N] "
# prefix eats four more. Defaults to MAX_NAME_LEN plus 8, so narrowing that for a
# narrow tab bar narrows titles with it.
# MAX_TITLE_LEN=28

# Titles that name the agent instead of the work it is doing, matched against the
# whole title, ignoring the case of ASCII letters. An agent sets one of these before
# it has a task (at startup, or once a session is cleared), and "Claude Code"
# says less than "claude" does. The agent's own kind, that kind followed by
# "code", the directory the pane sits in, and a bare number are refused without
# being listed. Assigning the array replaces the default; TITLE_IGNORE=() leaves
# only those built-in refusals.
# TITLE_IGNORE=("claude code" "codex cli" "gemini cli" "opencode" "amp code" "cursor agent" "new session" "untitled")

# Agents that stamp their own brand on the FRONT of every terminal title, as
# "<herdr agent kind>=<brand>" pairs. Most agents put their status glyph first and
# the plugin takes it off; oh-my-pi puts the brand first and the glyph second
# ("π ⠋ Fix the parser" while it works, "π > ..." at your turn, "π ! ..." when it
# wants you), so without the brand named here the glyph reached the tab and the
# label changed on every status change. The brand is removed only at the very
# front and only when a non-alphanumeric follows it, so a title that merely starts
# with the same letter keeps it, and the case of ASCII letters is ignored.
# opencode brands with letters rather than a glyph ("OC | Reviewing unpushed
# commits"); adding "opencode=OC" strips that. It is not in the default, because
# a brand is removed wherever a non-alphanumeric or the end of the string follows
# it: the entry would also turn "OC-192 incident" into "192 incident".
# Assigning the array replaces the default.
# TITLE_BRANDS=("pi=π" "omp=π")

# 1 = condense a title into its keywords instead of showing the agent's sentence
# with the tail cut off. MAX_TITLE_LEN takes the END off a title, which is where
# the words that say WHICH task this is tend to sit: "Investigate why the nightly
# ETL job drops rows" becomes "Investigate why the nightly". Condensing drops a
# leading verb and the filler and joins what is left, so the same budget carries
# "nightly-ETL-job-drops-rows" instead.
#
# It selects rather than generates: the words are the agent's own, in the order it
# wrote them, on the reasoning that it put the salient ones first. A title it
# cannot shorten to anything (all filler) is left as the sentence. The one
# exception is a first word longer than the whole budget, which is cut rather than
# dropped, since dropping it would leave no label at all.
#
# Off by default, so a config that does not name it gets exactly what
# AGENT_TITLES has always rendered.
# TITLE_CONDENSE=0

# Verbs dropped when a title OPENS with one. Every agent tab reading "Fix ..." or
# "Add ..." spends its first word on something the tab beside it also says. Only
# at the front, so "the auth rewrite needs review" keeps its "review".
#
# Measured against the last title Claude Code generated in each of 65 titled
# sessions on one machine over three weeks, which is the title the engine reads:
# this list fires on 35 and 30 of those gain a content word in the same budget,
# with no two DIFFERENT titles among the 65 colliding whether the rule is on or
# off (two sessions share a title, and those condense alike). Where a session
# was never titled the engine condenses the first typed prompt instead, and that
# population is not covered by those numbers.
#
# It matches spelling rather than part of speech, so a title whose subject shares
# a listed spelling loses it ("Plan needs approval" -> "needs-approval"), and
# taking that word out is the answer. The failure worth knowing about is a
# collision: "Review flashcard generation" and "Implement flashcard generation"
# both reduce to "flashcard-generation". Assigning the array replaces the
# default; TITLE_LEAD_VERBS=() drops nothing.
# TITLE_LEAD_VERBS=(review adjust add fix update create make check investigate debug refactor implement write set setup configure explore improve build test run clean remove delete migrate rename draft plan research diagnose audit analyze troubleshoot optimize show)

# Words dropped wherever they appear: a label is not a sentence, so articles,
# prepositions and phrasal-verb particles only spend the budget. Assigning the
# array replaces the default; TITLE_FILLER_WORDS=() drops nothing.
# TITLE_FILLER_WORDS=(a an the to for of on in at and or with from into via why how what that if whether is are be it its this up out off down over back)

# What joins the surviving words. The default fuses the label into one token, the
# shape every other tab name has; " " reads as the phrase instead. Its length is
# charged to MAX_TITLE_LEN like any other character.
# TITLE_WORD_SEPARATOR=-

# Casing. "fold" downcases every word except an all-caps-and-digits identifier: a
# sentence-case capital is the agent writing a sentence rather than signal, while
# the shape of "ETL" carries meaning. "lower" folds the identifiers too, "keep"
# leaves the agent's casing alone. Only ASCII letters are folded, so a non-ASCII
# capital reaches the label as written.
# TITLE_CASE=fold

# Name shown at a bare prompt. Defaults to your $SHELL's basename.
# SHELL_NAME=zsh

# 1 = don't name a shell tab at all: a bare prompt, an explicit shell, an
# IGNORED_PROGRAMS command, and the login shell itself (SHELL_NAME, which may be
# outside the SHELLS list) all leave the label empty, and herdr shows its own
# tab number there instead of "zsh". With AUTO_INDEX=1 the label keeps the jump
# number alone ("[3]"). Programs are named as usual either way.
# HIDE_SHELL=0

# Programs that count as "a shell prompt" and are shown by their own name.
# Assigning the array replaces the default; SHELLS=() disables the category.
# SHELLS=(zsh bash sh fish dash ksh)

# Programs shown by name only, without command-line args. Coding agents live
# here so an agent tab reads "claude" instead of its full invocation.
# NAME_ONLY_PROGRAMS=(nvim vim vi view gvim git lazygit gitui lazydocker claude codex aider)

# Quick commands that should not take over the tab name: while one runs, the tab
# keeps showing the shell so it does not flicker.
# IGNORED_PROGRAMS=(ls eza ll la cd z zoxide cat bat less more echo pwd clear which man head tail wc cp mv rm mkdir touch fzf sudo doas)

# Language runtimes and package runners that front for the program you actually
# launched. An agent installed from npm is usually a bin shim pointing at a JS
# entrypoint, so the foreground process is `node` and the tab would be named
# after the runtime; pip and pipx console scripts do the same through `python`.
# When one of these is the foreground program in a pane herdr has detected an
# agent in, the tab is named after that agent instead ("codex", not "node").
# Both conditions are needed, so a plain `node server.js` tab keeps its name.
# Add your interpreter here if it resolves to a versioned name (python3.12).
# WRAPPER_PROGRAMS=(node bun deno npx bunx npm pnpm yarn python python3 uv uvx pipx ruby)

# Rename specific programs on the tab. "<program>=<label>" pairs; wins over every
# rule except the bare-prompt shell name.

# Prepend a Nerd Font glyph (needs a Nerd Font). ICON_STYLE is one of
# name_and_icon (default), name, or icon.
# ICONS_ENABLED=0
# ICON_STYLE=name_and_icon

# Glyph shown when a program is missing from the builtin map (which comes from
# tmux-nerd-font-window-name's defaults.yml, ~170 programs). An empty string
# turns the fallback off, so unknown programs get no icon. Under ICON_STYLE=icon
# the fallback is treated as "no glyph": a bare "?" says nothing about the
# program, so the plain name is kept instead. Shell labels never get an icon
# either way (SHELLS, the login shell, and IGNORED_PROGRAMS commands): the tab
# is showing the shell, not the program.
# ICON_FALLBACK='?'

# Per-program icon overrides, "<program>=<glyph>" pairs; wins over the builtin
# map and the fallback. Glyphs are literal Nerd Font characters.
