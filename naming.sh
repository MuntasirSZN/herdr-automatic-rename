# naming.sh - pure, herdr-free name computation for herdr-automatic-rename.
#
# Sourced by automatic-rename.sh. Every function is string-in / string-out (no herdr
# or filesystem calls) so the logic is unit-testable on its own (see
# tests/test_naming.sh). Targets bash 3.2 (macOS /bin/bash): no associative
# arrays, no namerefs. Functions share the ar_ prefix with the engine, which
# calls ar_label across the module seam.
#
# Two environment variables are read for DEFAULTS, both below: $SHELL names the
# shell a bare prompt is labeled with, and $HOME is the directory ar_context_dir
# treats as nowhere in particular. Neither is looked up per call.
#
# Naming rule: a tab is named after its foreground program (nvim, claude, git,
# ...). At a bare prompt, or while a quick throwaway command runs, it shows the
# shell name (e.g. zsh) instead -- or nothing at all with HIDE_SHELL=1. Loosely
# modeled on tmux-window-name, minus the directory-based naming.
#
# Every list below is guarded with `declare -p` rather than `${VAR+x}`, so
# clearing one in config.sh (e.g. IGNORED_PROGRAMS=()) actually takes effect:
# `${VAR+x}` reports a zero-element array as unset and would overwrite it.

# Icon knobs, the glyph map, and ar_icon live in icons.sh (same directory) so
# this file stays free of the 100+ entry glyph table. Sourcing it here keeps
# every caller of naming.sh (automatic-rename.sh and the test suite) working
# unchanged. icons.sh loads after config.sh has run, so its defaults only fill
# unset vars.
